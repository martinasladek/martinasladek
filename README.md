# About 

I'm a PhD researcher in Psychology, with interest quantitative methods, meta-science, and R-stats. I primarily code in R, occasionally straying off into the murky waters of html, css, or python. 

## Repositories   

Most of my repositories are currently private while I'm finalising different side-projects and bits of research, though here's a handful that might be of iterest: 

### [`round`](https://github.com/martinasladek/round)

- A toy R package I've put together while learning about package development. It tweaks the rounding behaviour of R to be less chaotic. 
- [Link to `round` repository](https://github.com/martinasladek/round)

### [`shiny_robust`](https://github.com/martinasladek/shiny_robust)

- A basic proof-of-concept `shiny` app that allows fitting robust M-estimators with a point-and-click interface while printing out the underlying R code.
- [Link to `shiny_robust` repository](https://github.com/martinasladek/shiny_robust)
- [Compiled version of the `shiny robust` on shinyapps.io](https://martinasladek.shinyapps.io/shiny_robust/)
- [A blogpost briefly overviewing robust methods and stats software](https://www.martinasladek.co.uk/post/robust-statistics-in-jasp-and-jamovi/)

### [`advent_of_code`](https://github.com/martinasladek/advent_of_code)

- Contains R-based solutions to Advent of Code 2021 days 1-11. To be completed ... some day. I'll definitely have a go in 2022, ideally using fewer `for` loops!

### [`ms_net`](https://github.com/martinasladek/ms_net)

- The repository for my netlify website, due to an upgrade from `rmd` to `quarto`
- [`Link to `ms_net` respository](https://github.com/martinasladek/ms_net)
- See the [compiled version of the website](https://www.martinasladek.co.uk) for more info about my research and some blogposts.
